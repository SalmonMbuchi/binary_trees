# Binary Trees

In this project, I was introduced to the concept of the tree data structure. Specifically, the binary tree, methods of traversal and Big 0 notation.

A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children i.e. the *left child* and the *right child*.

### Terminologies

Some key terms include:
1. **Root** - the node at the top of a tree. There is only one root per tree
2. **Child** - the node below a given node connected by its edge downward
3. **Subtrees** - descendants of a node
4. **Traversal** - passing through nodes in a specific order
5. **Level** - generation of a node

## Traversal

There are three main of traversing through a binary tree namely:

1. **Preorder traversal** - node -> left -> right 
2. **Inorder traversal**: left -> node -> right
3. **Postorder traversal**: left -> right -> node
